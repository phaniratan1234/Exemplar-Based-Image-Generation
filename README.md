## üîç Overview

This project develops an advanced image inpainting system that uses **reference images** rather than text prompts to guide the restoration of missing areas in photographs. Unlike traditional inpainting systems that rely on text descriptions, our approach learns directly from visual examples, allowing for more intuitive and accurate results.

Our system specializes in understanding object relationships within scenes, ensuring that when objects are removed from an image, they are replaced with contextually appropriate elements that maintain proper spatial relationships with existing objects.

### What is Reference-Based Inpainting?

In reference-based inpainting:
1. You have a **target image** with missing areas (masked regions)
2. You provide a **reference image** showing similar content
3. The system fills in the masked areas by transferring appropriate content from the reference image
4. The result maintains the style of the target image while incorporating objects and patterns from the reference

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

Our approach consists of four main components:

1. **Progressive Unmasking**: Instead of filling in all missing parts at once, we gradually reveal and process the image through multiple steps, allowing the model to build a coherent understanding of the scene.

2. **Recorder Module**: A memory system that stores and reuses successful parts of previous inpainting attempts, ensuring consistency across multiple processing steps.

3. **Reference Integration**: Advanced techniques for extracting and utilizing visual information from reference images, guiding the generation of missing content.

4. **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Low-Rank Adaptation of a pre-trained diffusion model, specializing it for reference-based inpainting while requiring minimal computing resources.

## üåü Key Features

- **Object-Aware Processing**: Understands and maintains logical relationships between objects in scenes
- **Multi-Step Progressive Refinement**: Builds up the image gradually for better coherence
- **Memory-Enhanced Generation**: Remembers successful elements from previous steps
- **Style-Preserving Content Transfer**: Transfers content from reference while maintaining target image style
- **Resource-Efficient Implementation**: Uses LoRA for efficient fine-tuning on consumer GPUs (even Colab)
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**: Multiple metrics assessing different aspects of inpainting quality

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended) or access to Google Colab

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/reference-based-inpainting.git
cd reference-based-inpainting

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup for Collaborators

We use Git for version control and recommend VS Code for development:

1. **VS Code Setup**:
   - Install recommended extensions: Python, Jupyter, Git Graph, GitLens
   - Use our shared `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent formatting

2. **Collaboration Workflow**:
   - Pull latest changes before starting work: `git pull`
   - Create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
   - Commit regularly with descriptive messages
   - Create pull requests for code review before merging

3. **Google Colab Integration**:
   - Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory are Colab-compatible
   - Link your Google Drive to save checkpoints during training

## üìä Dataset Preparation

We use a curated subset of the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains images of everyday scenes with multiple objects.

### Dataset Details
- **Source**: COCO 2017 Validation Set (5K images)
- **Selection**: 500 images with multiple objects (3-4 objects minimum)
- **Resolution**: All images resized to 512√ó512 pixels
- **Organization**: Images paired with 2-3 reference images each

### Obtaining and Preparing the Dataset

```bash
# Assuming you've downloaded the COCO 2017 val set to ./downloads
python src/data_preparation/prepare_dataset.py \
  --coco_path ./downloads/val2017 \
  --annotations ./downloads/annotations/instances_val2017.json \
  --output_path ./data/coco_subset \
  --num_images 500
```

## üîß Implementation Details

Our system is implemented in PyTorch and uses Hugging Face's Diffusers library as the foundation. Here's how each component works:

### Masking Approach

We create object-based masks rather than random masks, specifically hiding objects based on their importance:

- **Progressive Masks**:
  - **Mask 1**: Only largest/main objects visible (others hidden)
  - **Mask 2**: Main and medium objects visible (small objects hidden)
  - **Mask 3**: Most objects visible (only smallest details hidden)

### Reference Integration Approaches

We implemented and compared three approaches for incorporating reference images:

1. **Concatenation** (baseline): Placing reference and target side-by-side
2. **Feature Conditioning**: Extracting CLIP features from references
3. **Cross-Attention Adaptation**: Modifying model attention to process visual features

### LoRA Fine-Tuning

We use Low-Rank Adaptation to efficiently fine-tune the inpainting model:

- **Target Modules**: Cross-attention layers and key UNet components
- **Parameters**: Rank=16, Alpha=32, Dropout=0.1
- **Training**: 200-500 steps on single GPU (Colab T4/A10)
- **Loss Function**: Combination of reconstruction, perceptual, and feature matching losses

### Running Inference

```python
# Example code for running inference
from src.inpainting import ReferenceInpainter

# Load model
inpainter = ReferenceInpainter(
    method="lora",  # Options: "baseline", "progressive", "feature", "lora"
    lora_weights="./models/reference_inpainting_lora.pt",
    use_recorder=True
)

# Run inpainting
result = inpainter.inpaint(
    target_image="./data/target_images/kitchen_001.jpg",
    mask="./masks/kitchen_001_mask2.png",
    reference_image="./data/reference_images/kitchen_034.jpg"
)

# Save result
result.save("./results/lora/kitchen_001_result.png")
```

## üìè Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate our system using both standard image quality metrics and reference-specific metrics:

### Standard Metrics
- **PSNR**: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (pixel accuracy)
- **SSIM**: Structural Similarity Index (structural preservation)
- **LPIPS**: Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (perceptual quality)
- **FID**: Fr√©chet Inception Distance (overall realism)

### Reference-Specific Metrics
- **Reference Transfer Accuracy**: How well appropriate content is transferred
- **Style Consistency Score**: How well inpainted regions match target style
- **Object Positioning Accuracy**: How logically objects are placed

### Running Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate results for all methods
python src/evaluation/evaluate.py \
  --results_dir ./results \
  --gt_dir ./data/target_images \
  --output_file ./evaluation_results.json
```
